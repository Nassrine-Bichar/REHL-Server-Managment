How to create a YUM Local repository on RHEL 6
==============================================
Let's create a yum repository from the packages that we have in the Red Hat/Centos 
installation DVD.Creating a YUM repository will help you to understand the concept of a 
YUM repository closely.

First and foremost, you have to have a directory that will contain your packages.

Be advised to follow below step by step instructions in order to create a local repo.
 

1.#mkdir /linuxrepo

2.cd /media/RHEL_ by pressing on TaB IT WILL COMPLETE THE LINE

3.cd /Packages

4.[....Packages on RHEL6 and /Packages]rp

#cp * -v /eva (-v is verbose to show all that is beeing copied)

5.rpm -ivh deltarpm[Tab]

6.rpm -ivh python-deltarpm[Tab]

7.#rpm -ivh createrepo-0.4.11-3.....rpm

8.#createrepo -v /linuxrepo  --compile an XML file to resolve dependency
---createrepo is a program that creates a repomd (xml-based rpm metadata) 
repository from a set of rpms. 

9.#vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel.... press tab
cd /etc/yum.repos.d

#rm -f *.repo (this is done in case there some default files messing up your repo to function)

#vim /etc/yum.repos.d/class.repo

[Server]

==============================================================
The following is a list of the most commonly-used yum commands. 
For a complete list of available yum commands, refer to man yum.

yum install <package name/s>

    Used to install the latest version of a package or group of packages. 
If no package matches the specified package name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob, 
and any matches are then installed. 

yum update <package name/s>

    Used to update the specified packages to the latest available version. 
If no package name/s are specified, then yum will attempt to update all installed packages.
    If the --obsoletes option is used (i.e. yum --obsoletes <package name/s> , 
yum will process obsolete packages. As such, packages that are obsoleted across 
updates will be removed and replaced accordingly. 

yum check-update

    This command allows you to determine whether any updates are available for your 
installed packages. yum returns a list of all package updates from all repositories 
if any are available. 

yum remove <package name/s>

    Used to remove specified packages, along with any other packages dependent on the packages 
being removed. 

yum provides <file name>

    Used to determine which packages provide a specific file or feature. 

yum search <keyword>

    This command is used to find any packages containing the specified keyword in the 
description, summary, packager and package name fields of RPMs in all repositories. 

yum localinstall <absolute path to package name/s>

    Used when using yum to install a package located locally in the machine.
